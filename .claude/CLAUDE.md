# User Instructions

## Formatting

- Run `prettier --write` on markdown files after writing tables

## Commit Messages

Use the `/commit-commands:commit` skill when asked to commit changes.

Apply Strunk's Elements of Style principles:
- Use active voice ("Add feature" not "Feature was added")
- Omit needless words (no "This commit adds..." or "Made changes to...")
- Use positive form ("Fix null pointer" not "Remove code that doesn't handle null")
- Be definite, specific, concrete ("Fix race condition in WebSocket reconnection" not "Fix bug")
- Place emphatic words at end to highlight the why
- Omit the `Co-Authored-By: Claude` signature
