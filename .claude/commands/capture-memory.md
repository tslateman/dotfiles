description: Capture learnings to MEMORY.md, output compact summary
allowed-tools: [Read, Edit, Write]

Reflect on the work just completed, then persist learnings for future sessions.

## Step 1: Reflect

Identify 2-4 concrete technical insights:
- Patterns discovered or reinforced
- Gotchas or surprises encountered
- Techniques that worked well (or didn't)

And 2-4 open threads:
- Unfinished work or TODOs
- Questions that came up but weren't resolved

Focus on *insights*, not actions taken. Be specific—name files, functions, concepts.

## Step 2: Write to Memory

Append learnings to your auto memory file (MEMORY.md in the project's memory directory).

Format for MEMORY.md:
```markdown
## Session: [date] — [brief topic]

### Learned
- [insight 1]
- [insight 2]

### Open
- [thread 1]
- [thread 2]
```

If MEMORY.md doesn't exist, create it with a header first.
Keep entries concise—this file loads into every session's context.

## Step 3: Output Summary

After writing to memory, output ONLY:

```
Captured to MEMORY.md:
- [1-line summary of each insight]

Open threads:
- [1-line summary of each thread]
```

Do not output the full reflection—it's in MEMORY.md now.
